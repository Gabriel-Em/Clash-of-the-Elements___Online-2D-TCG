# Clash of the Elements, a 2D Online Trade Card Game

This app served as my ***degree project*** and was inspired by an old TCG called **Duel Masters** that people used to play with physical cards. It features cards of 2 types **creatures** and **spells** having special effects, used to destroy your opponent's **safeguards** and attack him one more time in order to win.

# Building and running

#### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio (2015 or newer)

#### Compiling

You need to restore some NuGet packages before compiling. Follow these steps:

Open the **Package Manager Console** in Visual Studio:
- Tools -> Nuget Package Manager -> Package Manager Console

Execute:
```
PM> Install-Package NuGet.CommandLine
PM> nuget restore
```
Do that for both projects. Reopen the projects if neccessary.

Now you can build and run the projects.

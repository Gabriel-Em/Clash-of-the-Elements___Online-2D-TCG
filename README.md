Do not forget to restore the NuGet packages before compiling. Follow these steps:

In Visual Studio:
- Tools -> Nuget Package Manager -> Package Manager Console

run the following commands in the Package Manager Console: 
- Install-Package NuGet.CommandLine (if it isn't already installed)
- nuget restore

Do that for both projects. Reopen the projects if neccessary.

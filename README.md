# Clash of the Elements, a 2D Online Trade Card Game

This app served as my ***degree project*** and was inspired by an old TCG called **Duel Masters** that people used to play with physical cards.

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio (2015 or newer)

### Building and running

You need to restore some NuGet packages before compiling. Follow these steps:

In Visual Studio:
- Tools -> Nuget Package Manager -> Package Manager Console

run the following commands in the Package Manager Console: 
- Install-Package NuGet.CommandLine (if it isn't already installed)
- nuget restore

Do that for both projects. Reopen the projects if neccessary.

Now you can build and run the projects.

# WORK IN PROGRESS ...

TO DO:
- add gameplay, rules, screenshoots on this page
